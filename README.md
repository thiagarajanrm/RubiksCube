### B  - Bottom Clockwise
### B1 - Bottom Counter Clockwise (or Bottom Inverse)

### F  - Front Clockwise
### F1 - Front Counter Clockwise (or Front Inverse)

## Sides

### White -> Yellow
### Red -> Orange
### Green -> blue

## Alogorithm

#### Prerequsite
First arrange white in one side. You just need to make sure that 3 white tiles are available in one side. Make sure that the 4th white tile is just below the corner where you have different color tile. Then apply the following algorithm

# 1

$R^i$, D, R, $D^i$

$X^2$
